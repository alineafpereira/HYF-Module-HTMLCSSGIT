        <p class="soft">I could start saying that I am persistent. A lot. The kind of <b>persistent</b> that tries learn coding for years and
            end up in another country, all over the ocean away from my birth land, learning coding in another language. Which means that I am 
            also <b>dedicated</b> once I am still improving language skills in order to be able to follow classes and everything. Did I mentioned 
            that I am actually living abroad for the second time now? Yes, I am and my guess is I could translate this fact as a characteristic
            called <b>friendly</b>, because, well... no THAT easy be the foreigner and still I already have my networking. And if you are reading
            this now, I risk to say that I am pretty <b>persuasive</b> as well and now we probably should discuss when should I start working with you.
